# User CRUD Operations

## Setup

## Running

## Decisions
- I tried to minimize over-engineering, but at the same time demonstrate the structure of my average Node.js application (use-case specific, of course).

- I chose to call the interface **User** rather than **IUser**. The reason is, in the official TypeScript coding guidelines by Microsoft, it's explicitly stated that [interfaces should not be prefixed with "I"](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Coding-guidelines#names). I am not too opinionated about this, but in general I like going with the community rather than against it.
